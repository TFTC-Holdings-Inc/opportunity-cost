Yes—what you’re describing is a “reverse-targeting” or “pull” model, and it can absolutely work while keeping Opportunity Cost a privacy-first product. Here’s the basic shape:

1. **Partner deal objects, not user data blobs**

   - Each partner supplies a self-contained _deal object_:

     ```json
     {
       "id": "acme-cc-cashback",
       "description": "4 % bitcoin-back on groceries for six months",
       "eligibility": {
         "creditScoreMin": 700,
         "monthlySpendRangeUSD": [1000, 3000],
         "incomeBracketUSD": [60000, 150000],
         "kycRequired": true
       },
       "reward": "4% back in sats",
       "expiry": "2025-09-30"
     }
     ```

   - No PII or unique identifiers ever leave the user’s device.

2. **On-device matching engine**

   - The app keeps a _local_, encrypted financial profile (credit-score band, income band, spend categories, etc.).
   - When new deal objects arrive, a lightweight rule engine (e.g., JSONLogic or Open Policy Agent compiled to WASM) evaluates `eligibility` against the local profile. All computation stays client-side.

3. **User-driven disclosure**

   - If a match is found, the UI surfaces the offer in a “Deals” tab: “⚡ You qualify for 4 % bitcoin-back with Acme Card—tap to learn more.”
   - Only when the user taps _Apply_ does the app share the minimum required fields (or hand the user off to the partner’s flow). You can even pre-fill with an encrypted blob the partner can decode after the user consents.

4. **Privacy & security tech you can lean on**

   - **Bucketing / banding**: store ranges instead of exact numbers to avoid fingerprinting.
   - **Secure Enclave / Keychain** on iOS for local profile storage.
   - **Blind signatures / ZK tokens** (optional): let partners confirm eligibility without ever seeing raw data.
   - **Differential-privacy logging** if you need aggregate stats for partner reporting.

5. **Monetization & partner appeal**

   - Charge partners per _qualified view_ or _completed referral_—they’re paying only for users who meet their own criteria.
   - Because the match quality is strong and privacy safeguards are explicit, you can justify premium CPA/CPL rates.

6. **Regulatory checkpoints**

   - Treat the deal feed as “informational”—no personalized credit advice unless you have the licenses.
   - Provide clear disclosures that Opportunity Cost is not sharing PII unless users opt in.

**Why partners will still play ball**

- They avoid spray-and-pray marketing spend—they only fund offers shown to high-intent, pre-qualified users.
- You hand them warm leads with an _affinity signal_ (the user opened a privacy-forward finance app).

If this resonates, next steps could be:

- Formalize the deal-object schema and rule engine spec.
- Map the minimal user-profile fields you truly need.
- Sketch the UX flow and consent language.
