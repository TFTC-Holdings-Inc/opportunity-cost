# Saylor Mode Implementation Plan for Browser Extension

## Overview
Saylor Mode shows what items could cost in the future if Bitcoin reaches $21 million by converting today's price (in any supported currency) to BTC and back at the future price.

## Core Implementation Steps

### 1. Add Saylor Mode Preference
- [x] Update `UserPreferences` interface in `storage.ts` to include `saylorMode?: boolean`
- [x] Add toggle switch in settings section of `index-page.tsx`

### 2. Add Constants
- [x] Add `SAYLOR_TARGET_PRICE = 21000000` to `constants.ts`

### 3. Update Content Script
- [x] Check if Saylor Mode is enabled in `content.ts`
- [x] When enabled, modify price conversion:
  - [x] Convert fiat price (any currency) to BTC at current rate
  - [x] Calculate future value: `btcAmount Ã— $21M (converted to same currency)`
  - [x] Display result in fiat currency
- [x] Support all existing currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, etc.)

### 4. Update Background Script
- [x] Load and communicate Saylor Mode preference
- [x] Convert $21M USD base to all supported currencies using current BTC rates
- [x] Provide target prices to content script

## Implementation Complete!
All steps have been successfully implemented. The Saylor Mode feature now:
