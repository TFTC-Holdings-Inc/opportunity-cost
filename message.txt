Perfect—this is going to be a compelling content loop that hits nostalgia, regret, and Bitcoin clarity all at once. Here's a complete toolkit to start executing:

## ✅ 1. **Wayback Machine Use: YES, Highly Valuable**

Using the [Wayback Machine (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/) is a killer move for:

* Screenshots of old product listings (e.g., Apple.com, BestBuy, Zillow)
* Capturing original USD prices
* Grabbing authentic timestamps (e.g., “This fridge was \$799 in 2011, archived on July 3, 2011”)
* Pulling screenshots from old government, real estate, or auto dealer sites

Combine with Bitcoin’s historical price from sites like [CaseBitcoin](https://casebitcoin.com), [pricedinbitcoin21.com](https://www.pricedinbitcoin21.com), or \[CoinMetrics].

## 🎨 4. Visual Mockup Descriptions

I'll generate images shortly, but here’s what they’ll represent:

### Visual Type A: **“Price Over Time” Chart**

* X-axis: Year
* Y-axis: Price (split view USD vs SATs)
* Highlight: divergence over time
* App branding subtly included

### Visual Type B: **“Opportunity Cost of a Purchase”**

* Side-by-side:

  * Left: the item (e.g., Xbox in 2013)
  * Right: what those SATs are worth now
* Background: grayscale image of the product, bright colored SATs

### Visual Type C: **Screenshot of the Extension in Use**

* Real-time SATs calculation
* Line chart animation showing “SATs Deflation”
* “Track your inflation vector” tagline

I'll generate examples for you next. Any preferred item for the first visual (e.g., gas, iPhone, MacBook, rent)?
